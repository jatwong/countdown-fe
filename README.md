# Countdown Days
Countdown Days allow users to count how many days left to a certain day.

Users are able to register, login, reset passwords and add, edit, view, and delete date entries. The interface of this app is simple and straightforward.

### Technologies
+ Frontend: JavaScript, React, HTML, CSS (done by me, this repository)
+ Backend: Golang, MySQL, Docker (not done by me)

## Reflection
The goal of developing this app was for me to solidify, as well as put to use, everything I had learned about React and JavaScript.

+ Challenges I Overcame
    + Working with backend APIs such as fetching and using fetched data
    + Finding the optimal way to pass data to components
    + Writing and running unit tests

+ Future Improvements
    + Better organization of components and file
    + Better flow of components and data
    + Improve efficiency of using states and context
    + Incorporate Redux where possible
    + Modal operation for adding and editing entries?
    + Make the application responsive
    
With more practice, I hope to write cleaner code as well.
